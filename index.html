            <p align="center">Welcome to the Permanent Migration in Australia Dashboard! Here, you'll find a comprehensive overview of Australia's permanent migration trends since 2000, 
                presented through a series of interactive graphs using the data sourced from the <b>Australian Bureau of Statistics'</b> Census data. Explore key metrics, including <b>visa types</b>, <b>demographic breakdowns</b>, 
                and <b>regional distributions</b> of the <b>3 million permanent migrants</b> since 2000. This dashboard provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of permanent migration, helping policymakers, 
                researchers, and the public understand its impact on Australian society. Dive in to visualise the patterns and make informed decisions based on real-time data!

                    <p align="center">The above choropleth map shows the distribution of permanent migrants across Australia. The areas that are shown
                      are known as <b>Statistical Area Level 3</b> areas used by the ABS. These locations represent regional areas such as Alice Springs and Monash, 
                      which help to gain better understanding of these areas using Census data. These areas normally <b>contain between 30,000 to 130,000 people</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p align="center">
                        When we look further at the above map, the <b>lighter shades of green</b> represent regions with a <b>smaller proportion</b> of 
                        permanent migrants to those that are shader darker. As we can see, more regional/inland areas have a smaller proportion of permanent 
                        migrants most likely due to the smaller job availablity and lack of major towns/cities. We can also observe that there are much greater proportions 
                        of permanent migrants around cities like Melbourne and Sydney which are shown by the dark green shades. Again this makes sense as liveability in these 
                        cities is much better than rural areas of Australia.

                    <p align="center">In the above stacked area chart we can see that the cumulative sum of permanent migrants arrival <b>peaked in 2008</b> 
                        which is partly due to Australia's immigration policy of the <b>"Skilled Migration Program"</b> where the government focused on skilled migration 
                        from the 1990s. However the <b>Global Financial Crisis</b> hit in 2008 which rocked the world economy, affecting labour markets thus the demand for 
                        skilled migrants reduced significantly.

                    <p align="center">In the above grouped bar chart we can observe the breakdown of gender for each visa type as well as all visa types together. 
                    The most noticeable difference in gender split is for the <b>family visa</b> type where <b>63.8%</b> of them are <b>females</b>. Due to the nature of family type visas in Australia, 
                    this reinforces the government's preference for family reunification which is also supported in the combined bar chart for all visa types with <b>women making up 52.7% of all 
                        permanent migrants</b> in Australia since 2000

                <div class="description description">
                    <p align="center"> From the above stacked bar chart, we can clearly see how each age group contributes to the different visa types. 
                        We can see a very distinct difference in visa types <b>family</b> and <b>skilled</b> for the <b>60+ age group</b> which makes a sense as older people would be much 
                        <b>less likely to work</b> and are much more likely to move to be with their children that may have moved to australia early on a skilled visa. 
                        We can also see that the majority of migrants are between the ages 30-50 as shown by the "Total" bar. This again makes sense as the skilled visa is the most common visa type 
                        and people within this age range would most likely have built skills by this age or have family members that have moved across with them.

                        The graph uses colour to show the magnitude of migrants in each cell with a large number of migrants in that particular visa type are shown by darker colours and those with small numbers are the lighter colours. 
                        The visualisation shows that <b>most</b> of the visa types given are either <b>skilled or family</b> which is shown by the number of dark rectangles in those rows.
                        We can also look further into the countries and can understand that most of our permanent migrants come from <b>China</b>, <b>India</b> and <b>England</b>.
